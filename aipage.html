<b>Hayasaka Ai</b> Ai Hayasaka (早坂 愛はやさか あい, Hayasaka Ai) is one of the main character in the series. She is a second year student in Shuchi'in highschool and an employee of the Shinomiya family as Hayasaka is Kaguya Shinomiya's personal valet.
</font size><br><br>
<font size ="6"><b>Origin</b></font size><br><br>
<font size ="5">
Ai is based off of the celestial envoy from The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter who was tasked with returning Kaguya-hime to the moon.[1] This is reflected in the star pattern that can be found on most of her personal belongings.<br>
</font size><br>
<font size = "6"><b>Appearance</b></font size><br><br>
<font size = "5">Ai is a beautiful young girl with blonde hair that is most usually hair tied up at the left side of her head (She lets her hair down with a small braid tied on the right side when she's disguising as Haysaca A. Smithee) and blue eyes. Her expressions are flexible depending on the need and can express any emotion ranging from a cold stare to a look of pure love.</font size><br><br>
</font size>
<font size ="6"><b>Personality</b></font size><br><br>
<font size ="5"> Ai is a young girl that can adopt multiple personalities to suit the situation, most notably her gal mode and Firis high school mode. Not many people know about her true personality and it is apparently similar to Kaguya Shinomiya's personality. Despite being a part of the Shinomiya house, she is more loyal to Kaguya and acts more in the interest of Kaguya's happiness than to the Shinomiya house itself, going so far as to directly disobey orders from higher ups and disguising herself as Kaguya to let her enjoy the summer fireworks once.<br><br>

<font size ="6"><b>History</b></font size><br><br>
The Hayasaka family was once prominent, but lost their conflict to the Shinomiya family and, noted for their fine bloodline, were absorbed into it. Ai was born in the Shinomiya family's main house as a thoroughbred servant and was given a special education. She was born into and grew up in an isolated world like Kaguya Shinomiya was, but Ai is less sheltered.<br>
<br>Ai's father is Kaguya's godfather and her mother was Kaguya's wet nurse. They were raised together for a short period after their births, but Kaguya was moved to the Shinomiya main house on her second birthday, and they were only reunited at the age of seven, when their status as master and servant was made official. Their master/servant relationship is only on the surface, however their true relationship more resembles that of inseparable sisters. <br>
